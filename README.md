# DP_BasicReact
Basic React app to understand and implement the concept of components, props, routing, useState and useEffect and its types etc.

## Installing / Getting started
A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get the app running.

``` js
npx create vite@latest
```
This create the app. After that you need to write the project & package name (you can even skip this part).
<br>Then choose the required framework using which you intend to build this app (In this case, I have choosen React).
<br>Then choose the desired variant (Here you have 4 options: TypeScript, TypeScript with compiler, JavaScript & JavaScript with compiler). Here, I choosed JavaScript

You can even create react app through create-react-app but the execution speed of the program created through create-react-app (CRA) is slow compared to that of vite. CRA is used to create those app which is bit complex and large.
<br>To create React app through CRA, run the following command:

``` js
npx create-react-app "AppName"
```

Then run the following commands:
``` js
cd "folder_name"
```

``` js
npm install
```
**OR**
``` js
npm i
```
This code install the necessary packages required to build the project
``` js
npm run dev
```
It starts the development server. On following the link provided, you get to see the sample app.
<br>If you ever intend to change the command for runnig the code, you can do that by making some changes in the package.json file.

### Initial Configuration
Here are some of the dependencies and devDependencies packages needed to be installed for the project development
``` js
npm i prop-types
```
This package allows you to set the required dataType for the props which is passed as argument. If the argument passed is not of the type specified then, it throws console error
``` js
npm i react-router-dom
```
This package allows to navigate from one route to the other wihtout page refreshing
